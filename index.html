                <h3>TEST CRICKET</h3>
                <p>Test cricket, the longest and most traditional format, dates back to the late 19th century. It is considered the pinnacle of the sport, where matches last up to five days, and teams play two innings each. This format is often referred to as the "ultimate test" for cricketers, as it requires a combination of skill, patience, and endurance. Players must adapt to changing pitch conditions, weather, and the relentless strategies of their opponents over an extended period.

                    The beauty of Test cricket lies in its depth. A batsman can build a marathon innings over several hours, carefully crafting their score, while bowlers work tirelessly to find breakthroughs with precision and persistence. Iconic rivalries such as the Ashes, contested between England and Australia, and thrilling Test matches like India's historic series win against Australia in 2021, exemplify the enduring charm of this format. For cricket purists, Test cricket remains the ultimate arena to witness the sport's nuances.</p>

                <h3>ONE DAY INTERNATIONALS</h3>
                <p>One-Day Internationals (ODIs) emerged in the 1970s as a modern alternative to Test matches. Each team plays a limited 50 overs, ensuring the match is completed in a single day. This format offers a balanced mix of traditional cricket strategies and faster-paced gameplay, making it appealing to a wider audience. Teams must balance caution with aggression to score quickly while preserving wickets, creating a dynamic contest.

                    ODIs have hosted some of cricket's most memorable moments. The ICC Cricket World Cup, the pinnacle of this format, has seen historic games like the 1983 final, where India claimed their first World Cup, or the dramatic 2019 final between England and New Zealand, decided by a Super Over. These tournaments showcase the thrill and unpredictability of ODIs, where a single ball can change the game's outcome.</p>
